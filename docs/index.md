Imperium Repo is a powerful and highly performant all-in-one debugging tool to test and explore game mechanics and functionality in [R.E.P.O](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/). 

This is the official R.E.P.O. port of the original [Imperium for Lethal Company](https://github.com/giosuel/imperium).

!!! tip "Disclaimer"
    The Imperium mods were made with the intent to be tools to debug and explore game functionalities and provide more insight into the mechanics behind R.E.P.O. and Lethal Company.

    Imperium fully supports multiplayer as long as the host has it installed. I strongly stand against cheating and trolling in public lobbies. If you really want to cheat, at least put some effort into making your own hacked client!
