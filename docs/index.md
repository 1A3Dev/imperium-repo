Imperium is a powerful and highly performant all-in-one debugging tool to test and explore game mechanics and functionality in [R.E.P.O](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/).

!!! tip "Disclaimer"
    Imperium was made with the intent to be a tool to debug game functionalities and provide more insight into the weird and wonderful mechanics of R.E.P.O.

    I strongly stand against cheating and trolling in public lobbies. If you really want to cheat, at least put some effort into making your own hacked client!

## Features
