# Imperium Repo

A powerful all-in-one debugging and admin tool to test and explore game mechanics and functionality in [R.E.P.O](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/).

This is the official R.E.P.O. port of the original [Imperium for Lethal Company](https://github.com/giosuel/imperium).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Imperium mods were made with the intent to be tools to debug and explore game functionalities and provide more insight into the mechanics behind R.E.P.O. and Lethal Company.
>
> Imperium fully supports multiplayer as long as the host has it installed. I strongly stand against cheating and trolling in public lobbies. If you really want to cheat, at least put some effort into making your own hacked client!
